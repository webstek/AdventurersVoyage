# Adventurers' Voyage

## Project Proposal
### Purpose of the application:
- The application will run the Adventurers' Voyage game. It will be a **text-based story-driven RPG**, where the user will decide on a character race and profession, and play through a story which can be saved and reloaded at the user's conveinence. The game will implement a gui to display the current stats, health, and mana of the character and the enemies they are facing. Additionally, a list of items in the user's inventory will be accessable in the gui. However, the main inputs and outputs of the game will be text-based rather than a world for the user's character to walk around in.
### Intended Users
- This application is **intended for people interested in text-based games and RPG adventure games**. The intent is to design a game that has very low entry requirements because of basic input and no time-pressure events. Hopefully, the story will be engaging and long enough that the users feel the need to save and come back to it later.
### Personal Interst:
- Adventurers' Voyage is of great interest to myself as it presents a complex environment to develop my programming skills in a fun manner. I enjoy playing RPG's and wrote an extensive list of races and professions, including stats, effects, and descriptions) for a paper version of this game; implementing what I have already done into a computer game will be very interesting and rewarding, as I will be able share the game with friends whom I would not normally be able to meet and play a physical game with.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to obtain items and store them in my inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to see what items are in my inventory.
- As a user, I want to be able to see what stats races and professions have before I choose one.
- As a user, I want to choose a race and profession to play as.
- As a user, I want to enage in combat.
